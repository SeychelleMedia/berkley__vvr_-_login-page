							<p><strong>How We Collect and Use Other  Information</strong></p>
							<p> We and our  third-party service providers may collect and use other information in a  variety of ways, including:</p>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li><strong>Through       your browser or device:</strong> Certain       information is collected by most browsers and/or through your device, such       as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type, screen       resolution, operating system version and internet browser type and       version. We use this information to ensure Sites function properly, for       fraud detection and prevention, and security purposes.<br>
									<br>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Using cookies: </strong>Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on       the device you are using. Cookies we use do not contain or capture       unencrypted Personal Information. Cookies allow us to collect information       such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, language       preferences, and your relationship with us. We use the information for       security purposes, to facilitate navigation (i.e. to store your account       information between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes       you have requested during your session), to display information more       effectively, to personalize/tailor your experience while engaging with us,       and to recognize your device to allow your use of our online products and       services. We collect statistical information about the usage of the Site       in order to continually improve the design and functionality, to monitor       responses to our advertisements and content, to understand how account       holders and visitors use the Site and to assist us with resolving       questions regarding the Site. We also utilize cookies for advertising       purposes. Please see the <strong>Advertising</strong> section below for more information.<br>
									<br>
									You  can refuse to accept these cookies and most devices and browsers offer their  own privacy settings for cookies. You will need to manage your cookie settings  for each device and browser you use. However, if you do not accept these  cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site and some  online products and services. The site may not load or display properly.

							</ul>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We       may use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use       of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often       users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what       other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. We use the information       we get from Google Analytics only to improve this Site. Google Analytics       collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this Site,       rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine       the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with       personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a       permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the       next time you visit this Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but       Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google       Analytics about your visits to this Site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>.

									<br>
								</li>
								<li><strong>IP       Address:</strong> Your IP Address is a number       that is automatically assigned to the device that you are using by your       Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged       automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site,       along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.       Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the internet and is done       automatically by many websites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as       calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, advertising,       for compliance and security purposes and administering the Site. Please       see the <strong>Advertising</strong> section below for more information.<br>
									<br>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Aggregated       and De-identified Data:</strong> Aggregated and De-identified Data is data that we may create or compile       from various sources, including, but not limited to, accounts and       transactions. This information, which does not identify individual account       holders, may be used for our business purposes, which may include offering       products or services, research, marketing or analyzing market trends, and       other purposes consistent with applicable laws.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3><strong>Our Commitment to Security</strong></h3>
							<p> To protect  Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures  that comply with applicable federal and state laws. These measures may include  device safeguards and secured files and buildings as well as oversight of our  third party service providers to ensure information remains confidential and  secure. While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the  Personal Information submitted to us (both during and once we receive it), no  method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is  100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to  protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

							<p> Our  site may contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook,  and Twitter, whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors  should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over  information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
							<p><strong>Business Transitions</strong></p>
							<p> In the event that we go through a business transition, such  as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our  assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the  assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Site for  30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal  Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal  Information.</p>
